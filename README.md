Play a game of Fifty Bird! (Flappy Bird remake)

This is Assignment 1 of Harvard's edX GD50 class. The instructor, Colton Ogden, created the bulk of the code for making the game. I updated it mainly by adding rewards, a pause screen, and variability to the game.

List of Updates:

- Added medals: bronze for scores of 5-9, silver for scores of 10-19, and gold 
  for scores of 20 and above.
- Added pause screen with a sound effect
- Implemented pipe gap length variability
- Implemented variability in space between pipes
- Made pipes narrower
- Made vertical location of gaps differ more from pipe pair to pipe pair
- Made bird stop on the ground, even after game is lost. The bird remains on the 
  screen after the loss.
- Made bird fall to the ground on score screen after colliding with a pipe
- Added "utility.lua" file to keep global constants in one place
- Other small changes to game and code
