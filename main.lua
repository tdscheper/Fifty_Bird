    Flappy Bird Remake

    "The Reward Update"

    A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple 
    but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping 
    the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly. 
    A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet
    for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game
    levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting
    as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.

    - Added medals: bronze for scores of 5-9, silver for scores of 10-19, and gold 
      for scores of 20 and above.
    - Added pause screen with a sound effect
    - Implemented pipe gap length variability
    - Implemented variability in space between pipes
    - Made pipes narrower
    - Made vertical location of gaps differ more from pipe pair to pipe pair
    - Made bird stop on the ground, even after game is lost; the bird remains on the 
      screen after the loss
    - Made bird fall to the ground on score screen in front of pipes after colliding with a pipe
    - Added high score functionality
    - Added "utility.lua" file to keep global constants in one place
    - Other small changes to game and code
